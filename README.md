WARNING /!|

<h2> Further Use </h2>

For the purposes of Assignment 1 in the 'Cloud and Advanced Analytics' course, access to the BigQuery cloud database on Google Cloud is facilitated through a specific .json key. Please be advised that, to maintain security and control over access, this key will be deactivated following the grading of the assignment. 
Consequently, no further use of this access method will be possible thereafter. However, the codebase will remain accessible for review.

+ If the link doesn't work anymore it's because everything on the cloud has been deactivated.

<h2> Instructions from the university </h2>

<h3> Goal </h3>
The goal of this project is to implement a user-friendly interface that enables users to query a movie database hosted on Google Cloud. The application should provide functionalities to search for movies based on different criteria and filters.

<h3> Details </h3>
In this assignment, we implemented a web application that enables users to search for movie titles and apply advanced search functionalities. Users can specify filters such as language, genre, release year, and average rating to refine their search results.

<h3> Functionalities that I needed to implement in order to get all the points </h3>

  1. Autocomplete: Helps users explore movie titles based on input text.
  2. Filter by language: Allows users to filter movies based on language.
  3. Filter by genre: Enables filtering movies by genre.
  4. Filter by average rating: Users can search for movies with an average rating above a specified threshold.
  5. Filter by release year: Allows users to specify a range of release years.
